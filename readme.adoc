This guide contains practical material for the tutorial _Multi-Agent Oriented Programming_ at https://sites.google.com/inf.ufpel.edu.br/wesaac2023[17th Workshop-School on Agents, Environments and Applications (WESAAC 2023)], 2023, Pelotas - Brazil.


== Smart Room Scenario

The objective is to develop an MAOP system to control the temperature of a room so that it reaches some desired temperature

* The room is equipped with a "Heating, Ventilating and Air  Conditioning" (HVAC), that provides

** the current room temperature
** operations to start cooling, start heating, and stop the machine

* initially we have one agent that has the goal of maintaining a certain temperature

== Agent Dimension - Agent basics (Lab 1)

Objectives:

* Know the basic structure of JaCaMo applications;
* Run a multi-agent application;
* Understand the difference between agent implementation and agent instance;
* Have a first experience with the implementation of _goals_, _beliefs_, _plans_, and _internal actions_.   

=== Task 1: Run the initial project for the smart room scenario

The simplest way to run the examples and do the exercises is by using https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/JaCaMo-EASSS23/code[GitPod, following this link] (a github account is required). You can also work locally by cloning this repository (https://github.com/maiquelb/jacamo-wesaac2023). Java JDK 17+ and VSCode should be installed locally in this case.



To run the initial project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd hands-on/lab1
./gradlew
----



=== Task 2: Reading and understanding agent programs

* Exercise 1.2.1: open the code of the personal assistant agent (file `src/agt/personal_assistant.asl`), read the code and identify the beliefs, goals, and plans. Try to map the program to the observed behavior. 

* Exercise 1.2.2: open the _mind inspector_ for agents `bob` and `marie`. Compare the beliefs there with those identified in the program. Are they the same? Are they represented the same way? 

=== Task 3: Extending the agent program
* Exercise 1.3.1: Add a new personal assistant agent to the system. This agent should greet in portuguese ("Bom dia.").

* Exercise 1.3.2: Set the language of bob to japanese without adding any plan. Run the system and observe the output. Handle exceptions if needed.


==== Questons:
* Where to the beliefs come from?
* Where are the actions implemented?


== Agent x Environment (Lab 2)

Objectives:

* Have a first experience with programming agents that perceive and act upon the environment (without to implement it);
* Understand the difference between _internal actions_ and _external actions_
* Understand the difference between declarative and procedural goals;
* Understand more complex agent design patterns.

=== Task 1: Run the initial project for the smart room scenario

To run the initial project, type the commands below in the terminal:
----
cd lab2/
./gradlew
----

You can see how the system reacts to changes in temperature by opening another terminal and executing the command:

----
curl -X POST  http://127.0.1.1:8080/workspaces/room/artifacts/hvac/properties/temperature -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[ 10 ]'
----

replacing the last number 10 by the current temperature of the room.


=== Task 2: Reading and understanding agent programs

* Exercise 2.2.1: open the code of the room controller agent (file `src/agt/personal_assistant.asl`), read the code and identify the beliefs, goals, and plans. Try to map the program to the observed behavior. 

* Exercise 2.2.2: open the _mind inspector_ for agent `rc` and compare the beliefs there with those identified in the program. Are they the same? Are they represented the same way? 

* Exercise 2.2.3: change the program so that the target temperature is 15.

=== Task 3: Improve the implementation

* Exercise 8: add a new plan to print the current state of the HVAC.

* Exercise 9: change the plans of the previous exercise so that when the hvac state is `"cooling"` it is printed "so cool" and, when the state is `"heating"` it is printed "so hot".

* Exercise 10: open the project in folder `lab2/e10` and take a look at the room controller program. There is a difference in the last lines (line 17). Evaluate the reasons for that modification and its problems. Some ideas about how to fix?

* Exercise 11: open the project in folder `lab2/e11` and take a look at the room controller program. The target temperature is as an argument of goal `keep_temperature`. The project, as it is, works. But what happens if a line like `!keep_temperature(35)` is added in the program? Explain the behavior produced by this change.


==== Questons:
* Is it possible to observe a different pattern between the plans to achieve `greet` and `keep_temperature`?
* Which actions of the agent are _internal actions_?
* Which actions of the agent are _external actions_?


== Agent Communication (Lab 3)

=== Task 1: Experiment different performatives

* Exercise 1: open the project `lab2/e1`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the two agents, and execute the application. Now change the plan of Bob to:
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, tell, hello);
      .send(alice, tell, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. Now change the plan again to
+
----
+!start 
   <- .send(alice, signal, hello);
      .send(alice, signal, hello);
   .
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. 

* Exercise 2: open the project `lab2/e2`, read the `.jcm` file and the program of the three agents, and execute the application. Use the mind inspector to see the beliefs of the agents (specially Alice). Now change the plan of Alice to:
+
----
+!start
   <- .wait(500);
      .send(karlos, askOne, vl(_), vl(X));
      .println(X).
----
+
run the project again and notice the difference. 

* Exercise 3: open the project `lab2/e3`, read the program of the three agents, and execute the application. List the sequence of exchanged messages and their performatives. Finally, use the mind inspector "link of plans" (in the bottom of the page) to see the plans of Alice.


=== Task 2: Improve the project for the voting protocol

You can run the project with the following commands:
----
cd lab2/smart-room-ma
./gradlew
----

* Exercise 4: change the list of options offered to the personal assistants. 

* Exercise 5: run the voting protocol twice, with two different options and notice possible problems.

* Exercise 6: currently, the `id` of the conversation is fixed to 1, this may cause problems when counting the votes. Change the program of the room controller so that the identification is an argument for the goal `voting`.

* Exercise 7: upgrade the previous version so that the conversation id value is incremented each time a voting protocol is executed.

* Exercise 8: add a new personal assistant. Does the application work properly? The rule `all_votes_received` is hard-coded for 3 participants. How to make it flexible? Think about possible solutions. Hints: see the internal actions link:https://jason.sourceforge.net/api/jason/stdlib/all_names.html[`.all_names`] and link:https://jason.sourceforge.net/api/jason/stdlib/df_register.html[`.df_register`].

== Environment Dimension (Lab 4)
Objectives:
* Exercise the basic skills to implement _artifacts_, which are the JaCaMo environment building blocks;
* Create and initialize _artifacts_;
* Create and update _observable properties_;
* Use _signals_;
* Implement _operations_.

Consider a new scenario where the _personal assistant_ cannot access the hvac. Such access is restricted to the _room controller_. To keep the desirable temperature, the _personal assistant_ must ask the _room controller_ to manage the hvac. The _room controler_ then manages a voting to check the preference of all the _personal assistant_ and manages the hvac accordingly.

//We will now implement the voting mechanism as an artifact: has no longer access to the hvac. 

//will use a _voting machine_ artifact to select the target temperature for the shared room based on their individual preferences.

//Most of the code required for this practical session is already provided in the link:lab3/smart-room-vm[lab3/smart-room-vm] project. The following tasks will guide you through adding the last lines of code that will bring everything together.




=== Task 1: Implement the usage interface for the voting machine

The artifact template for our voting machine is defined in the link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/env/voting/VotingMachine.java[VotingMachine.java] class, but the usage interface is not yet fully implemented. Your first task is to complete this implementation. The following sub-tasks will guide you through it, note also the `TODO` items marked in comments in the Java class.

- Exercise 4.1.1: complete the artifact's `init` method by defining an observable property `voting_status` and setting its value to  `closed`.
- Exercise 4.1.2: complete the implementation of the `open` and `close` operations.

To solve these tasks, you will have to define and work with observable properties. Tips for a quick start:

- you can have a look at the implementation of the link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/env/devices/HVAC.java[HVAC artifact]
- you can check out https://cartago.sourceforge.net/?page_id=69[Example 01 — Artifact definition, creation, and use] from https://cartago.sourceforge.net/?page_id=47[CArtAgO by Examples]


=== Task 2: Instantiate and use the voting machine

Your voting machine is now ready — and the room controller agent is, in fact, already using it (see link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/agt/room_controller.asl[room_controller.asl]). Still, a few bits are missing:

- Task 3.2.1: Complete the `TODOs` defined in link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/agt/room_controler.asl[room_controler.asl] so that agent open a new voting when needed.


- Task 3.2.2: Complete the `TODOs` defined in link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/agt/personal_assistant.asl[personal_assistant.asl] so that agents can focus on the voting machine and vote for their preferences.

- Task 3.2.3: Complete the `TODO` defined in link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/agt/personal_assistant.asl[personal_assistant.asl] so that agents shows the current temperature in its log message.




=== Task 4: Implement a linked operation

Your agents are happy with their brand new voting machine — and would like to showcase it to other agents via https://dweet.io/[Dweet.io]. Luckily, they already have a link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/env/social/DweetArtifact.java[DweetArtifact] artifact template that they can use for this purpose.

Your task is to complete the link:lab3/smart-room-vm/src/agt/room_controller.asl[room_controller.asl] agent program with the following steps (see `TODOs`):

* Line 20: to create an instance of a `DweetArtifact` after creating the voting machine

* Line 23: to link the voting machine to the newly created `DweetArtifact` using the operation `linkArtifacts(ArtId1, "port", ArtId2)`

** note: the voting machine artifact template already defines an output port named `publish-port`

** for further examples and documentation on linking artifacts, see https://cartago.sourceforge.net/?page_id=126[Example 08 — Linkability] from https://cartago.sourceforge.net/?page_id=47[CArtAgO by Examples]


If you enjoyed this practical session, make sure to check out https://cartago.sourceforge.net/?page_id=47[CArtAgO by Examples] for a complete tour of all features supported for the enviornment dimension.


Note: the _personal assistant_ keeps asking the _room controller_ to change the temperature while it does not matches the agent's preference. To change the preference of the agents in running time, use the following command, replacing `<agent_id>` with the agent name and `<pref_temp>` with the preferred temperature.
----
curl --request POST 'http://127.0.1.1:8080/agents/<agent_id>/command' --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data-urlencode 'c=-+preference(<pref_temp>)'

== Organisation Dimension (Lab 4)

=== Task 1: Reading and understanding an organization

* Exercise 1: in this project the purpose is to coordinate the actions of agents when posting on a forum. There are two agents alice and bob; alice is responsible for posting a message and bob for retrieving the post. Open the project `lab4/e8`, read the `.jcm` file and the agents' program, and execute the application. Explain why is the displayed `Received message` content is empty? What does happen if `<- .wait(2000) ; retrievePost(-1) ;` replaces of line 7 in `src/agt/forum_agents.asl`?

* Exercise 2: open the project `lab4/e9`, read the XML organization specification and identify the organization roles, goals, missions and norms. Execute the application, open the _organization inspector_ (http://localhost:3171) and verify the state of the agents' goals. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the organization approach to coordination compared with the approach in Exercise 1?

* Exercise 3: comment out the lines 15-21 in `src/agt/forum_agents.asl` and execute the application. Use the _organization inspector_ to verify why the application does not execute properly. Hint: Look at the msg_vacation scheme.

=== Task 2: Changing the organization

* Exercise 1: open the project `lab4/smart-room-org`, execute the application and analyze the results of the group and scheme in the _organization inspector_.

* Exercise 2: change the maximum number of `assistant` to 2. Execute the application. What is the outcome? Change the organization to solve the problem and keeping the maximum number of `assistant` to 2?

* Exercise 3: change the order of `announce_options` and `open_voting` in the scheme `decide_temp`. What changes do you observe in the outcome?

* Exercise 4: parallelize the execution of the `announce_options` and `open_voting`. Analyze the result of the new scheme in the _organization inspector_.

* Exercise 5: replace line 14 in `src/agt/personal_assistant.asl` (`?options(Options)`) by `?vm::options(Options) ;`. This change allows to simplify the `decide_temp` scheme and the `src/agt/room_controller.asl` agent code. Identify and make the simplification.

=== Task 3: Handling the state of the organization

* Exercise 1: implement a plan in the `room_controller` agent that displays all fulfilled obligations. Hint: consider the organizational event `oblFulfilled/1`.
+
----
oblFulfilled(O) : Obligation O was fulfilled
----

* Exercise 2: implement a plan for the `personal_assistant` agents that reacts to the achievement of the organizational goal `closing_voting` by printing the current temperature. Hint: consider the organizational belief `goalState/5`.
+
----
goalState(S, G, LC, LA, T) : Goal G, of scheme S, is in state T (possible values for T are waiting, enabled, and satisfied); LC is the list of agents committed to the goal, and LA is the list of agents that have already achieved the goal.
----
